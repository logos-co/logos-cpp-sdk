  # propagation order through nixpkgs (propagatedNativeBuildInputs vs
  # propagatedBuildInputs) can't reliably guarantee that ordering. So
  # consumers must list `qtbase` + `wrapQtAppsNoGuiHook` themselves;
  # this set carries the rest (OpenSSL, Boost, nlohmann_json) so they
  # don't have to retype it just to satisfy `find_dependency(...)`
  # inside the SDK's CMake Config or to link against the SDK's
  # transitively-required symbols (e.g.
  # `boost::asio::ssl::host_name_verification`).
