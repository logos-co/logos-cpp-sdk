# The runner is the shared `doctest` CLI
# (https://github.com/logos-co/logos-doctest), invoked directly via its flake.
# `doctest run` executes every command in a temp directory and asserts on the
# output; `doctest generate` renders each spec to Markdown under outputs/;
# `doctest clean` strips build artifacts so only the generated docs remain.
